I am a former atheist to Eastern Orthodox convert and as such much of my worldview will come from that perspective.

### The Name
I took on the name Seraphim after St. Seraphim of Sarov, and Fr. Seraphim Rose, both of whom I hold in high regard. Seraphim is the plural form of a seraph, an angelic being believed to be in the highest of the celestial hierarchy in heaven. They are described as "six-winged and many-eyed" and their main description is given in Isaiah.

*I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, with the train of his garment filling the temple. Seraphim were stationed above; each of them had six wings: with two they veiled their faces, with two they veiled their feet, and with two they hovered aloft. “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts!” they cried one to the other. “All the earth is filled with his glory!” At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke.”*  Isaiah 6

Even as angelic beings they, out of humility and reverence to God, hid their faces from him because they understand that no-one not even the highest of the angels are worthy to stand before God.
