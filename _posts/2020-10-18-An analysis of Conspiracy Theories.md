title: "The Feasibility of Conspiracy Theories"
description: "An essay on the etymology and history of conspiracy theories"
---

In recent history the term "conspiracy theory" is often hurdled to discredit the arguments of people of the opposite ideological spectrum, the most famous example being the removal of Alex Jones from almost every major social media platform (Twitter, FB, Apple App Store), and even Paypal. It is often coupled with the label of **"conspiracy theorist"** to deplatform people without addressing actual arguments and theories at hand. In this essay I want to explore the etymology and history of the term and argue that there is a long historical precedence for world leaders to conspire and achieve their socio-political goals.

###Etymology
Firstly, the word **conspiracy** means the 'act of conspiring together' or 'an agreement among conspirators'. To 'conspire' means to 'join in secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrong act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement' or even to 'act in harmony toward a common end'. The word has Latin origins with 'con' meaning "with or together" and "spire" or to breathe, or in other words to breath together, or to embody the same "spirit". To put this together with theory we get **conspiracy theory** approximately meaning a theory or hypothesis about a group of people working together to end, usually diverging the mainstream explanation for historical and current events. If we use the meaning strictly derived from etymology, almost every major historical event involving political coups and revolutions involved groups of people conspiring to take power for themselves. What was called conspiracy in the moment, we now simply consider and label as history. Rarely do we ever associate the word "conspirators" with groups like the Sons of Liberty, or the Founding Fathers who both conspired against the British crown.

The non-etymological meaning of the word has often taken on the a dismissive tone, typically meaning a theory that is untrue or outlandish. It labels a theory as something not worthy of serious consideration. Sometimes this dismissiveness is understandable given the wide variety of conspiracy theories (some more probable than others) and how often they coincide with another, so that while a person may have very strong reasons and evidence to support one theory, that person may also believe a related theory just because of its close ties. For example, one is much more likely to believe that the Earth is flat if one presupposed that the 1969 moon landings were fake, or vice-versa. This is not to dispute the veracity or falsity of the claim just mentioned, but to state that there are "memeplexes" or ideas that tend to congregate with one another, x.

###Common Objections

Before we go any further, I would like review common objections to conspiracy theories and respond to them.

* That they resist falsification
* Become a matter of faith rather than reason
* That they are subject to circular reasoning
* Are believed by people who are psychologically disturbed (paranoia) or subject to illusory pattern perception
* Hiding certain activities would require the cooperation of an impossibly large amount of people without someone whistleblowing.

**Falsification** - Many scientific theories that are taken as de-facto dogma in the scientific community are in practice unfalsifiable. This does not make them true or false. As John F. McGowan, a researcher and engineer at NASA, states in his article on [falsification](http://jmcgowan.com/Myth.pdf) *"A scientific theory can often be modified in such a way that the core assumptions of the theory remain true and unchallenged but some lesser, peripheral assumptions are modified to **make the theory agree with seemingly contradictory evidence*** ". For example, in physics and cosmology, Albert Einstein proposed, under the General Theory of Relativity, that the universe that must be expanding but since this was not yet observed he added the cosmological constant to his formulation in order to make it consistent with observations. Using this constant it achieved a static universe (space is neither expanding nor contracting). When evidence from Hubble in 1931 showed that it WAS expanding, the cosmological constant was dropped (equal to zero). Most recently, in 1998, it was discovered the at the expansion of the universe is accelerating, indicating the possibility of a positive nonzero value for the constant. So both cases (a static-universe vs a non-static universe) Einstein was right even when he was wrong. Dr. McGowan concludes that *"One can easily see that if the expansion had not been discovered the cosmological constant would have been retained and **again the theory would have been confirmed by observations***". So this standard of falsifiability is a double standard, often leveled against theories and worldviews that stand outside of the mainstream view, but not towards accepted theories even though they are often modified to explain contradictory data.

**Matter of Faith** - Here is a false dichotomy between faith and reason, often held by those beholden to scientism but even sometimes by Christians. Because this a similar objection as falsification so I will continue the example with astrology. Because the prevailing theory is unfalsifiable, there is a certain degree of faith or lack thereof that one must have in it. I say faith because there are contending models that challenge the LCDM models such as the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) that are supported by similarly credentialed and who I assume to be intelligent researchers. More specifically, they challenge the model due to the fact that dark matter/dark energy has never been observed despite the rigorous search for their presence in the universe. Thus, the alternative models are likely based in a **lack of faith** in dark matter due to the paucity of evidence for them. This lack of faith is based in reasonable grounds, namely that at this point in time dark matter has not been observed. Though proponents of one theory or another would not necessarily describe their stance as one a matter of faith (due to deeply held convictions about faith being opposed to reason), it essentially boils down to just that. In short, reason can inform and justify faith.

**Circular Reasoning** - The golden calf of modernity and of the West is the scientific method. It is used as standard par excellence of establishing objective facts about the world, but This too is subject to circular reasoning because the scientific method cannot justify the scientific method. This is best explained in one of the most famous problems of philosophy (and of science) through David Hume's problem of induction. It highlights the lack of justification for the ability to make universal statements based on particular observations about the world, and the presupposition that future events will occur just as it has in the past.

In other words, if I as a scientist observe that there experiment X produces result Y 100 times, I have observed 100 particular cases of X->Y. I then go on to propose that as a universal rule every time I conduct X I will get Y. This presupposes that
1) The 100 cases of X->Y which I have observed can be generalized to a universal rule: X will always produce Y.
2) The future instances in which I conduct experiment X will resemble the past instances in which I conduct experiment X.

Hume calls into question this jump from particulars to universals (1) as well as the principle of uniformitarianism (2). The circular argument can be seen more clearly when it is restated... The principle X->Y is true because it has always happened. It can be flipped... it has always happened because X->Y is true. The premise presupposes the conclusion, and vice-versa the conclusion presupposes the premise. In other words, it becomes something like "It is what it is" or axiomatic.

**Psychological issues** - It may very well be possible that people who believe conspiracy theories are more likely to be mentally ill or have psychological issues, and that this issue might characterize the right-wing more often than the left-wing. But this is more of an ad-hominem attacking the mental state of people who do not subscribe to the mainstream narrative than an attack on the argument.

**Difficulty of hiding conspiracies without being exposed** - This argument is based on Dr. Grime's paper titled "On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs". In this paper he uses probability and mathematical models to make the case that 'grand' conspiracies such as NASA moon-landing conspiracy, climate-change hoax, vaccination conspiracy, and conspiracy to hide cancer cure is impossible. Interestingly, he admits that in smaller types of conspiracies involving 1000 people or less it would be possible to keep a single conspiratorial event below detection.

The problem with this paper is that it's assumptions are far too simplified and assumes that everyone in a group has equal access to the same information. It ignores a very standard practice in military and intelligence communities called **"need to know"** or **"compartmentalization"/"compartmentation"**. The practice restricts sensitive information only to those who "need to know", aiming to discourage leaking of information by limiting access to that information to the smallest number of people possible. This is typically done to prevent that information falling to the hands of the enemy in times of war, but it can also be used to hide it from the general populace or even other members of the same organization. In other words, the answer to any question that did not pertain to your specific task/job was "It's classified".

For example, in the Manhattan project the "need to know" prevented even [Harry S. Truman](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-is-briefed-on-manhattan-project ), then Vice-President, from  knowing of the existence of the project until the President Roosevelt had passed away on April 12, 1945 and Truman was sworn in. The Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) enforced a strict policy of compartmentalization that 'production plant blueprints be broken down and distributed in such a way as to reveal as little as possible to any one individual about the overall character of the project'. General Leslie Groves who oversaw the construction of the Pentagon, and directed the Manhattan project stated [this](https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/docs/ci2/2ch1_f.htm)..

*"Compartmentalization of knowledge, to me, was the very heart of security. My style was simple and not capable of misinterpretation **each man should know everything he needed to know to do his job and nothing else.** Adherence to this rule not only provided an adequate measure of security, but it greatly improved overall efficiency by making our people stick to their knitting. And it made quite clear to all concerned that the project existed to produce a specific end product—not to enable individuals to satisfy their curiosity and to increase their scientific knowledge."*

The Manhattan Project is now widely known among the public so it is not the best example of successful compartmentalization. However, the point was to show that this is standard practice in the military-industrial complex (sometimes coincidentally overlapping with the scientific community).

### Examples
Let's go over some of the more popular conspiracy theories.

* NASA faking the moon landing via collaboration with Hollywood
* JFK Assassination being planned by secret societies
* Deep State/NWO  
* Jeffrey Epstein's death being a suicide
* 9/11 being a controlled demolition

Something that has to be noted is that conspiracy theories are theories only up until they are vindicated.. Examples of conspiracies in recent history that would have STAYED conspiracy theories if they were not investigated by people like Carl Bernstein in the next example below, or if someone had not confessed to the truth include like US Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in the second example..

* Watergate Scandal in which the Nixon's administration's attempts to break into the DNC and their conspiracy to cover it up by using federal officials to deflect.
* Gulf Of Tonkin incident in which the US fabricated claims that Northern Vietnam had attacked US Navy destroyer USS Maddox in order to escalate conflict in Vietnam.
* The 72 times the US tried to change other country's governments.

### Epistemological Challenges
Like some scientific theories, many are plausible and are unfalsifiable. That is unfalsifiable unless admitted to at a later date by a conspirator or through declassification of documents. And similar to other theories, conspiracy theories are more often a matter of BELIEF or NON-BELIEF and sometimes whatever is in between, rather than a matter of TRUE or FALSE. This is because there are epistemological barriers to practically ALL historical events as most of what we know is based on the testimony of other people. By the very nature of the past, it is not possible to access it anymore, except through the testimony of those alive or those dead. Even much of what we know what is happening in world today is digested through medium like news organization, social media, etc. The reliability of news is often judged by if it can be verified by other news organizations also labeled as credible, but is it possible that they are reporting circularly, and are simply playing a game of telephone? Or in other words, is what is happening in the world only credibly "happening" if enough *"reliable"* news sources report on it and verify it? And is the opposite true... is it possible that events are not "happening" if the *"reliable"* sources are not reporting on it? In short, can an event be entirely fabricated (or erased) if the people at the institutions through which we perceive the world willed it?

###Insitutional Analysis
What we know and what we DONT know is heavily filtered through institutions and organizations like the NYT, CNN, CBS, NBC, Time, etc, and government agencies like the CIA, FBI, White House Press Secretary. In theory, the journalist and figures at these organizations have duties to deliver the truth to the world, and specifically to the American people. And under this theory, they would call one another out if there was misleading reporting, holding one another accountable. But what if, that theory weren't true? That there was reason to believe the journalism promised by them is not true, or more often a mixture of lies and truth. Or that by the lack of reporting on certain issues makes a problem or issue practically non-existent among the American populace.

So lets dive into some factual events that wouldn't alienate or offend the traditional party lines... There are generally two kinds of relationship between the government (intelligence agencies to be more specific) and the media. The first in which they work hand-in-hand as partners, though not necessarily 100% in cooperation. And the second in which the government knowingly misleads the media in order to prop a narrative.

This history of partnership between our most trusted sources of information and the unelected non-partisan portion of our government started in the mid 20th-century. For this portion of the essay I will be quoting extensively from an [essay](http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php) published by Carl Bernstein on October 20,1997 on the CIA's relationship with the media. There are several key figures that we have to keep track of...

* Allen Dulles - 1st civilian Director of the CIA (DCI) overseeing the Bay of Pigs invasion, Project MKULTRA, The 1953 Iranian coup de'tat, and the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. Allen and his brother John Foster Dulles (Secretary of State at the time under Eisenhower) were both on United Fruit payrolls, likely the financial incentive behind the overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman in 1954.  
* Charles Douglas Jackson -
* Henry Luce
* Arthur Hays Sulzberger

Those called conspiracy theorists have reason to believe that the people at the institutions are not trustworthy, and there is a sizeable heap of evidence to support them. The question is not whether these institutions lie. The question is whether the lies that they have sold the American people merit a categorical loss faith in them.
