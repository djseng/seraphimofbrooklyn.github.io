title: "The inevitability of Idols, Rituals, and Religion"
description: "An essay on how religion is built into our consciousness, even if we do not call it a religion. "

In this essay I would like to explore how atheist and agnostic people, or "spiritual but not religious" people hold religious beliefs. On the macro-level this would translate to how 'secular' governments with no explicit state religion end up propagating systems of belief that are essentially religious.

To start I will introduce two "models" of representing the world, one denoting hierarchy and the other denoting spatial/epistemological relationships.

The first model can be represented by a simple pyramid in which the higher or more "spiritual" informs the lower or more material world. In scientific terms a single hypothesis unites to itself many different observations by offering some explanation for it such as the Big Bang theory proposing that red shift is due to an expanding universe. This model can even be applied to organization, linguistics or humans itself as seen in Figure 2, 3, and 4.
