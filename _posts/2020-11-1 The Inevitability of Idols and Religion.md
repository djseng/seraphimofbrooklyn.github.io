### Introduction to Epistemological Models

In this essay I would like to explore how atheist, and to a lesser extent agnostic and "spiritual and not religious" people hold beliefs that are fundamentally religious. On the macro-level this would translate into how explicitly 'secular' governments with no state religion end up propagating systems of belief that are essentially religious.

To start I will introduce two visual models of representing the world, one denoting hierarchy and the other denoting spatial/epistemological relationships.

</figure>

The first model can be represented by a simple pyramid or mountain in which the higher or more "spiritual" informs the lower or more material world. In scientific terms a single hypothesis (immaterial) unites to itself many different observations of physical phenomena by offering some explanation for it such as the Big Bang theory proposing that phenomena like red shift is due to an expanding universe. This model can even be applied to organizations, linguistics or to the human being as seen in Figure 2, 3, and 4.

The second model is represented by concentric circles, being an alternative view of the first model. If Hierarchical model were a side or frontal view of a mountain, the circular model is the birds eye view of it. It can be likened to the concept of **axis mundi** or the centre of the world. The centre is contrasted with the margin just as the peak of the hierarchy is contrasted with the bottom. Where the centre is known and orderly, the outside is unknown and chaotic.

So what does any of these funny figures have to do with religion or idolatry? The answer is simple. We all worship something. This may be a bitter pill to swallow for some readers but let me explain in detail.

### Defining Worship
By worship I do not mean the typical means of worship one may accustomed to like making pilgrimages to holy sites, praying, or attending religious services, though worship can definitely include these things. Worship and idolatry can look like people lining up to see celebrities or artists as in Figure 4 below. One can worship money and orient ones life only to the pursuit of generating wealth. Or one can worship justice and the pursuit of enacting justice by becoming a lawyer and working pro-bono for underprivileged communities. One 'worships' or 'idolizes' what one holds most important, what is the **highest** or what the very **centre** of their being. This will create a pattern of behavior that is predictable as it will be **oriented** towards that centre.

One can imagine that within every person there is a mountain representing their identity and values as well as their relationships. The people most congruent with their identity and values lie closest to the center while those that are most opposed to them lie outside  at the circumference. For example, for someone who is 'spiritual not religious' that principal value would be 'love', 'peace', or 'unity'. Or for someone that is a strict athiest who prizes rationality above all else that which lies at the centre would be 'truth'.

Similar to how the head of a hierarchical organization directs those who are lower, the centre will organize everything outside of it. In other words, belief dictates action. For the atheist, prioritizing a materialist truth above all else, they will rule out the admission of certain ideas they deem to be false from entering into the centre. This may or may not preclude the entrance of people they disagree with into their life, such as deeply religious people who hold metaphysical beliefs contrary to those of their own, but it will generally exclude the regular attendance of corporate gatherings of people with beliefs different than their own such as the attendance of a mosque, church, etc. If the they do admit adherents into their lives it will be despite those differences rather than because of them. And lastly if any are allowed into the inner circle the conflicting beliefs between the atheist and the thiest may be humored but never allowed to displace the fundamental centre.

Atheists, and any other belief system, named or unnamed, have 'priests', 'sacred texts' 'churches', 'dogmas', 'cosmologies', 'ethics', 'processions' 'conversions', etc. Their priest or evangelist the one who are those who advocate for truth in a convincing manner like Sam Harris, Bertrand Russel or Christopher Hitchens. Their 'sacred texts' are essays like 'Why I Am Not a Christian' or 'The God Delusion'. Their churches are the secular universities.  Their dogma and cosmology: Darwinism, and the Big Bang theory and so on and so forth. To hold something to be important,  is to have set it apart from the rest, as something sacred. Whether or not the term sacred is not important. What is important is that the meaning is the same and the patterns of behavior is the same.
