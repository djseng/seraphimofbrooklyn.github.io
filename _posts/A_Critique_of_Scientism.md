### 3. Worship of Science (Scientism)

This last form of worship is related to the last two, as it is another form of self worship. Empiricism, or the belief that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience, is foundation of the scientific method. The exaltation of this epistemological method has led directly to scientism which is defined as such: **the belief that science is the absolute and ultimate method of defining truth, and that given enough time all human problems will be dealt with and solved by science alone**. One often hears on the headlines of pop science "Science says x", or "Scientists say x" as if science were an autonomous entity speaking through the scientists to enlighten the masses.

Taken to an extreme, scientism, especially if combined as it often is with materialism and naturalism, **denies the existence of anything that cannot be empirically observed by the scientific method**. Nevermind the fact that this mentality is self-refuting (you cannot empirically observe the scientific method) and that this would deny the existence of numbers, of the past, the future, moral values, and even categories themselves. It also takes for granted metaphysical principles that cannot be justified by the scientific method. Most importantly is Uniformitarianism upon which the most widely accepted scientific theories such as the Big Bang Theory or the theory of evolution depend. These serve as the **cosmology**, and the **anthropology** for the modern world.

Fervent science advocates often forget that science and the scientific method are merely tools, and cannot inherently make moral judgements. Science, in some cases, can tell you what **is** but not necessarily what **ought** to be. This is referred to as a the is-ought problem in which morals cannot be derived from science, rather it has to be overlayed on top of science. I say it **HAS** to be because **science pursued for the sake of science has led to innumerable instances of immoral, and atrocious acts**. These include the Japanese Unit 731 led by Shiro Ishii and the German Auschwitz camp led by Josef Mengele, both of which conducted human experimentation at the cost of countless lives. Many of the perpetrators were not brought to justice but through programs like Operation Paperclip German and Japanese researchers **they were pardoned for scientific knowledge they could offer** to the United States. This is not to excuse America's own crimes even against their own people in the pursuit of "scientific knowledge". Through operations like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, MKULTRA, Operation Sea-Spray (and the 200+ bacterial attacks like it).

The scientific method is neutral, just as government, knives, or cars are. These are all tools that can be wielded properly with telos, in the pursuit of something good. People who fund and promote scientific research understand this. The tobacco industry used the scientific prestige of C.C. Little, an important figure in 20th century genetics (and eugenics), and other scientists to attack scientific studies that were critical of tobacco. There was **financial interest** to use science to fight science that was endangering their industry. A similar thing happened with the sugar industry in the 1960s. It is also why the US government, despite the Szil√°rd petition protesting use atomic bombs on Japan until Japan had accepted or refused American surrender terms by the scientists that invented the atomic bomb, detonated two nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki: because they had a **political agenda**.

Despite all of the flaws of science, and of it being dependent on extremely wealthy and influential interests, there are still people who fall in line parroting the lines of science advocates who act as evangelists for the movement. Science apologists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris attack religion for its rigidity, its dogmatism, and its susceptibility to manipulation but they turn a blind eye to the religious structure in which they inhabit, not recognizing that the very same things can be used to describe the ~~religion~~ very thing they advocate for.
