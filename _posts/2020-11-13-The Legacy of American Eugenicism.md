description: "A short expose on the close relationship between Darwinism, Eugenics, and Planned Parenthood."

### Short History of Darwinism
Darwinism...
### Short History of Eugenics
The theory of Darwinism soon expanded to the other sciences, and eventually to all areas of society, particularly in anthropology, genetics, health, etc. Thus birthed eugenics and social darwinism primarily through the works of Galton.

### American Eugenics Society
The American Eugenics Society was formed...
### Eugenics Report office at Cold Spring Harbor Labratory
The Eugenics
### Nazis  
This is obvious but
### Rockefellers
The Rockefellers, and especially John D. Rockefeller were particular interested in improving the human condition.
### Margaret Sanger
Margaret Sanger is a modern day icon, but much of her legacy is tainted by her belief in eugenics and her association with many of the most prominent eugenicists of the day.
### 21st Century legacy

Initial thoughts - lots of overlap between eugenicists and ways to "improve the race" via euthanasia, abortion, selective breeding, contraception/birth control, family planning to the point that many of Nazi connections.  Weirdly enough a couple are conversationsalists such as Madison Grant, and Henry Fairfield Osborn. This is not surprising given the majority of these eugenicists are scientifically minded and did major study of the natural world and probably loved the environment very much. Many were biologists, zoologists, anthropologists.

In some of the organizations there was a literal transition from eugenics to simply biology by simply changing the name such as the Eugenics Education Society to the Galton Institute, and American Eugenics Society to the Society for Biodemography and Social Biography.

Additional connection between Malthusian League and Eugenics Education Society via Alice Vickery (husband 1st president of Malthusian League). There is also an occult/theosophical twist when you consider that Annie Besant's role  in the founding of Malthusian League. George Bernard Shaw, a prominent member of the Fabian society who recruited Besant into the Fabian society also was an advocate for eugenics.

Sanger met Marie Stopes (eugenicist, and founder of Britains first birth control clinic with Humphrey Verdon Roe her husband) at Fabian Society so throw in socialist mix. Woman's rights (Annie Besant, Alice Vickery, and Marie Stopes) is also overlapping here as it advocates for birth control. So you have theosophical, globalist, socialist, secularist, malthusian types all intertwined even 100+ years ago. Lastly, It seemed that the British eugenicists were much more inclined to be openly secular than the American counterparts.

Journals - Eugenics Quarterly -> Social Biology
Eugenics Review (British) -> Journal of Biosocial Science
Birth Control review

Key Institutions:
Carnegie Institutions - Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW) in 1904 created the Station for Experimental Evolution at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, New York
