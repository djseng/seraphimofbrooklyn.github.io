"I'm still not convinced that reason is the path either towards or away from divine revelation, or divine experience, or divine relationship..."

"In the end how does a conclusion... how does a rational language logical argument do anything for your soul. How does that do anything for your life?"

"You're not going to get to God through your brain"

"There is no way that I can actually communicate that with the tools has offered, except for certain strands of mysticism like basically mystic tradition through mostly monotheistic religions..."

In reponse to the interviewee going back to Scripture highlighting the mystical experience of the apostles.

"What makes it unique then?... What makes it so unique that it stands in the way of me attaining it myself? That I have to rely on these guys that aren't around anymore to get close to God, who created me" - Boyce

"I can't come up with a good natural explanation for the things that they were saying, the things that they were reporting, besides that a man literally died and rose again from the dead. To me when I way out the evidence it seems like that is literally what happened. And so if i believe that is a thing that happened in history that Jesus actually rose from the dead that is SEISMIC. That's huge" - Esther O' Reilly

"Yea but that was 2000 years ago"

"And I love human beings and I see that human beings are broken but I am coming to restore that and I'm coming to bring healing " - Esther O' Reilly

"Eventually? or now....." "I don't really care about the physical healings I'm talking about the... if we're broken we're broken in spirit. And if I'm not going to be fixed in spirit until after I die and i have certain words in my mouth and my brain then I get fixed in the end that doesn't matter to me. Even if God, let's just take that all the claims that are true, it is still me and my capacity of experience that I'm hinging my entire eventual fixedness on. Like I want to be fixed now I wan to go through the process now while I'm alive with my volition to experiment, to mess up, and to get taught lessons and to find guidance, and to build something out of myself. I don't want to just put it all on hold because of a bunch of claims whether they are true or not."- Boyce

"If I wasn't in control of myself and then I realized why do I need to be forgiven for something I didn't even know I was doing wrong. If I just simply evaluatemy behavior and adapt my behavior what does forgiveness add that other than psychological weight to that process of getting better"

These words encapsulate a frustration with the Western paradigm of belief vs non-belief in God as the way to God. Without the mysteries of the EOC, and the recognition of the essence-energy distinction you are left with ADS which irrevocably sets apart God from man.

Ben is confused as to the RELEVANCE of the historical figure of Christ relates to Him. Even if Christ was who he said we was... the God-man how does that affect me today?  How can I enter into relationship with God?
